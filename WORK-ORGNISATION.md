The first step presenting by Amghar Cherif talk about the plan of our project also the creation of a simple case of square Billiard, the second step presenting by Amahjour Walid talk about the creation of a function who lists words and the creation of a flat torus billiard, the last step presenting by Cheroy Leo talk about the elliptic case.

To do this work we follow this strategy:

First : create a simple case of Billiard and the function who list the words.
Second : create a flat torus Billiard.
third : we try to create an elliptic case.
