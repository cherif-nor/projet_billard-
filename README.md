##GOAL:

The goal of this project is to be able to produce videos and widget representing a point/ball in a billiard with a simple shape and showing its trajectory.


## Plan:


### Square case:


 he simple case would be a square billiard, with no friction and satisfying the Descartes rules.
 A game to play with this billiard would be to create words associated to trajectories:
 Start with an empty word.
 Then, when the ball hit the top or bottom part you add an H (H for horizontal) 
 and when the ball it the left or right part, add a V (V for vertical).
 Perform a statistical analysis of the words creating depending on
 the angle use to start the trajectory (restrict may be to words of size <2000).

### Flat Torus case:

 You then will study the case of the flat torus billiard.
 A flat toru is described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus#Flat_torus, if needed.


### Elliptic case:


Finally, provide elements mimicking the following video:
