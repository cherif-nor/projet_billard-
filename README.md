## GOAL:

The goal of this project is to be able to produce videos and widget representing a point/ball in a billiard with a simple shape and showing its trajectory.


## Plan:


the plan of this project is:

Firstly, create a simple case of square Billiard with no friction and verified the Descartes rules and to  play this game we should create a words associated to trajectories, starting wit a simple word then when the ball hit the up or down part we add an H (for horizontal) and when the ball touch the left or right part, add a V (for vertical). 

Secondly, create flat torus billaird.

Finally, provide elliptic case.
